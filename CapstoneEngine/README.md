## Capstone Engine

The SHA1 hash for this lib is: 
```
F:\VS Projects\Project\Project\Release\capstone>certutil -hashfile capstone.lib sha1
SHA1 hash of capstone.lib:
70d3bbffe1086ce3d8859243581fc21438adc665
CertUtil: -hashfile command completed successfully.
```

As like Unicorn, you can just compile the test.cpp file to ensure it works. This code is directly from the capstone website
```
F:\VS Projects\Project\Release>Project.exe
0x1000: push            rbp
0x1001: mov             rax, qword ptr [rip + 0x13b8]
```

Happy coding!
